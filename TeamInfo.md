## Project Summary
The Uber for Trucks project is designed to offer a ride-sharing platform specifically tailored for individuals and businesses needing freight transportation. The app connects users with truck drivers for efficient and reliable transportation of goods, allowing users to choose from different vehicle types based on their load size and delivery requirements. With an easy-to-use interface, users can input pick-up and drop-off locations, select the appropriate truck, and track the delivery in real-time. The platform also offers an estimated cost calculator that factors in distance, truck size, and delivery urgency, making the process transparent and convenient for both users and drivers.

In addition to standard transportation services, the app incorporates advanced features such as route optimization and dynamic pricing systems. The route optimization algorithm helps drivers navigate the most efficient routes by taking into account real-time traffic, weather conditions, and road restrictions. Meanwhile, the dynamic pricing system adjusts rental costs based on real-time supply and demand, ensuring that users get competitive rates and drivers are fairly compensated during peak times. These features create a more intelligent, cost-effective, and reliable solution for freight transportation.
